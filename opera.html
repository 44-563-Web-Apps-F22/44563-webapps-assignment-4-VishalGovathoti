    Act 2 
</h6>
<p>
   <h6>SCENE</h6>
<p>
     the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
    of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
    interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
    of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
    back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it.  All the substitute
    gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered
    grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
    drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.

  <h6>CHO</h6>
    <p>
     Of all symposia
         The best by half
         Upon Olympus, here await us.
         We eat ambrosia.
         And nectar quaff,
         It cheers but don't inebriate us.
         We know the fallacies,
         Of human food
         So please to pass Olympian rosy,
         We built up palaces,
         Where ruins stood,
         And find them much more snug and cosy.

  <h6>SILL</h6>
  <p>
   To work and think, my dear,
         Up here would be,
         The height of conscientious folly.
         So eat and drink, my dear,
         I like to see,
         Young people gay—young people jolly.
         Olympian food my love,
         I'll lay long odds,
         Will please your lips—those rosy portals,
         What is the good, my love  
Of being gods,
         If we must work like common mortals?
        </p>

    [Exeunt all but Nicemis, who is dressed as Diana and Pretteia,
    who is dressed as Venus. They take Sillimon's arm and bring him
    down]

<h6>SILL</h6>
    <p>
     Bless their little hearts, I can refuse them nothing. As
    the Olympian stage-manager I ought to be strict with them and
    make them do their duty, but i can't.  Bless their little hearts,
    when I see the pretty little craft come sailing up to me with a
    wheedling smile on their pretty little figure-heads, I can't turn
    my back on 'em.  I'm all bow, though I'm sure I try to be stern.
</p>
 
  <br>
  <h6>PRET</h6> 
  <p>
  You certainly are a dear old thing.
</p>
  <h6>SILL</h6> 
  <p>
  She says I'm a dear old thing.  Deputy Venus says I'm a
    dear old thing.
</p>
  <h6>NICE</h6>
    <p>
     It's her affectionate habit to describe everybody in those
    terms. I am more particular, but still even I am bound to admit
    that you are certainly a very dear old thing.
</p>
   <br>
  <h6>SILL</h6>
    <p>
     Deputy Venus says I'm a dear old thing, and Deputy Diana
    who is much more particular, endorses it. Who could be severe
    with such deputy divinities.
</p>
<br>
  <h6>PRET</h6>
    <p>
     Do you know, I'm going to ask you a favour.
    </p>
  <h6>SILL</h6>
    <p>
Venus is going to ask me a favour.
</p>
  <h6>PRET</h6> 
    <p>
You see, I am Venus.
</p>
<br>
  <h6>SILL</h6>
    <p>
No one who saw your face would doubt it.
    </p>
  <h6>NICE</h6>
    <p>
No one who knew her character would.
    </p>
<h6>PRET</h6> 
    <p>
Well Venus, you know, is married to Mars.
